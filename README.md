# EquipSettlerCL

## Description

- The pure source files for EquipSettlerCL based on CMake.
- The build process using CMake or XMake is not included.
- The code in Papyrus.cpp is 1:1 transferable between the CMake and the XMake built out there.
- I hope this helps people write some more plugins for CL.

- Please also see my fork of CommonLibF4 from alandtse, it has some important bugfix for empty arrays packing/unpacking.
